- **Feature Flags in `:virgo add`:**
  When adding crates, always check the available features and specify them using `-f` to prevent unnecessary bloat.
  
  ```bash
  :virgo add serde -f derive
  ```

- **Version Comparisons:**
  Before updating any dependency, run `:virgo compare` to see if the bleeding-edge commits have any breaking changes compared to the stable release.

- **Backup Routinely:**
  Make it a habit to use `:virgo backup` before large modifications, ensuring you can always `:virgo restore` to a safe state.
